,E3,E1,Mild lowlands,"Occurs all around Antarctica with particular concentrations on the Antarctic Peninsula, in the Transantarctic Mountains, and Victoria Land. Dominates the coastal outcrops around the eastern margin of the continent.","Relatively warm, flat/level habitats, often coastal but not always. Elevations are low and topography is gentle. May be rocky and barren, but often hosts bird colonies and pinnipeds if occurring near the coast."
13,E3B1,E1B1,Mild coastal inclines and beaches,Occurs mainly in the coastal Antarctic Peninsula and Marie Byrd Land. Very common on beaches of coastal islands off the Peninsula. Minor occurrences on the coast of the Transantarctic Mountains and East Antarctica. ,"Rocky, gently sloping lowlands in warm, cloudy mesic (high snowfall) areas; has seasonal snow cover and usually exhibits meltwater erosion channels. This unit supports a rich biota dominated mainly by lichens, mosses and seabirds. Colonies of penguins on the coast and nesting seabirds influence moss beds upslope enriched by nutrients via updrafts. Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica) occurs occasionally within this system at low elevations on the Antarctic Peninsula and associated islands, but not in other areas. The microbiota is likely to exhibit strong regional variation within this unit around the continent. Based on sampling, these areas appear to be the most favoured ecosystem for several species of seabirds (terns, gulls, skuas), mosses, mites, and springtails. A favoured nesting environment on the Peninsula for the southern giant petrel, which has been sampled in large numbers. This unit has the highest sampling of 102 relatively common species (at least 10 occurrences), and 20 of these are found in this unit for more than 50% of their samples."
14,E3B2,E1B2,Meltwater-eroded flatlands,"Occurs mainly on the Antarctic Peninsula, but a scattering of this unit can also be found coastally in the Transantarctic Mountains, Victoria Land, Marie Byrd Land. There is a coastal patch of this Habitat Complex in the Bunger Hills, East Antarctica. ","Rocky, gently sloping lowlands characterised by high seasonal melt and meltwater erosion, creating a complex, dynamic terrestrial surface, and higher rugosity than is usual for the group. Satellite imagery suggests a layer of loose, crumbling soils in some areas. Common mosses and lichens are its dominant biota, but the unit may host chinstrap penguin colonies. Sampled biota includes a number of cyanobacteria and Ochrophyte species that are apparently unique to this habitat. "
15,E3B3,E1B3,Xeric valley floors,"Occurs primarily in South Victoria Land (particularly the McMurdo Dry Valleys area). Minor occurrences also exist on the northern shore of Alexander Island, in Dronning Maud Land and the Transantarctic Mountains.","Sloped or rolling valley sides or low outcrops in valleys typically carved by antecedent glaciers and transitioning to steeper cliffs and high peaks. The valleys may extend many kilometres inland and are strongly sheltered from the wind and sun and are extremely dry. Some incidence of this unit is also seen between the edge of existing glaciers and steeper mountain slopes. These systems are colder than the rest of the lowlands, but still warmer than the continental average. The vegetation is sparse due to extremely dry conditions, characterised mainly by Lecanorid and Teloschistid lichens with high suitability for Stereocaulid lichens, nematodes, trombidiformid mites, rotifers, green algae, and springtails. Highly characteristic moss Encaplypta procera found primarily in this habitat."
16,E3B4,E1B4,Exposed rocky flatlands,"Occurs mainly in the Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land with a scattering of sites in Marie Byrd Land, Enderby Land, and the Prince Charles Mountains. Notably, the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica are primarily composed of this habitat.","Cold despite low elevations, little snowfall but often contains lakes maintained by meltwater streams. Terrain is especially low and flat. Wind tends to be high as this unit is not sheltered by topographic features. Samples comprise mainly lichens and mosses, and also several species of diatoms. Suitability is high for lichens in the families Acarosporaceae, Parmeliaceae and Lecanoraceae. An unusual number of green algae, and cyanobacteria species are attributed to this habitat, however, this is likely due to extensive sampling in and around lakes that are often found in this habitat. "
17,E3B5,E1B5,Subcoastal exposed mossy outcrops,"Dominates Adélie Land, Enderby Land and East Antarctica, with patchy occurrences found coastally scattered around the western side of the continent.","These mossy ecosystems occupy low-relief rocky outcrops in the sub-coastal hinterlands or directly on the coastline. Conditions are sufficiently warm and sunny to promote moss growth, but windier than other coastal systems in E1, leading to presence of aeolian (wind-eroded) contours. Several processes are likely to enhance habitat suitability for mosses by promoting nutrient enrichment. Many occurrences coincide with current or abandoned penguin colonies that were active earlier in the Holocene when sea levels were higher than at present. Toxic nitrogen levels associated with previously active colonies have since been leached, while residual levels of N and other nutrients promote moss growth. Alternatively, more elevated sites receive nutrient influxes from nesting seabirds or aerosol inputs via updrafts from extant penguin colonies below. While mosses are often conspicuous features of these systems, lichens and some nematodes are also widespread; they are popular with snow petrels, Wilson’s storm petrels, and several cyanobacteria species are characteristic of occurrences in different regions of the continent. A number of moss and lichen species that are common across many ecosystems are nonetheless most common in this habitat."
18,E3B6,E1B6,Glacial outwash plains,"Aside from patchy relatively minor occurrences (< 100 km2 per bioregion) in the Antarctic Peninsula, the Transantarctic Mountains, Enderby Land and the Prince Charles Mountains, this habitat is found primarily in Victoria Land, particularly in the McMurdo dry valleys (~800 km2), which constitutes over half of its total area.","Located primarily at the terminus of glaciers, outwash plains contain debris and sediment from meltwater outflow that is often sorted by size, with larger rocks and boulders nearer to the glacier and smaller particles such as silt farther away. In Taylor Valley, by far the largest continuous incidence of this uncommon habitat, the outwash plain is a part of the Ross Sea 1 Drift (Perotti et al. 2018, Hawes et al. 2021) and contains a variety of interbedded substrates including gravel, silt, and sand. The habitat often contains an abundance of kettle lakes and may be crisscrossed by meltwater streams."
19,E3B7,E1B7,Dry lowland lichen fields,Patchy occurrences around much of Antarctica. Found most commonly in the Transantarctic Mountains Victoria Land but there is also a notable concentration of this habitat on James Ross Island and minor patches in the Ellsworth and Prince Charles Mountains.  ,"Primarily occurs on flat, rocky terrain or low outcrops on cold, dry and windy coastlines (though there are occasional occurrences inland), commonly (but not exclusively) adjacent to ice shelves. Characteristic biota includes several common moss and lichen recorded primarily from this unit. Nutrient fluxes potentially influenced by emperor penguin colonies on adjacent ice shelves. Suitability is high for all functional groups. Several otherwise unusual species of lichens have been sampled most frequently in this habitat, including several Teloschistaceae (genus Caloplaca) and Lecanoraceae. "
400,E3B8,E1B8,Penguin colonies,"Coastal outcrops all around the edge of the continent and Antarctic Peninsula, and on off shore islands","This assemblage is distinguished by large nesting colonies of AdÃ©lie, chinstrap and gentoo penguins. They select ice-free shorelines (< 300 m from the coast) with gentle topography, low elevation (usually no more than a few metres above sea level), and high insolation. Nesting sites also tend to have high cloud cover, snowfall, and long growing season even relative to other E3 units, but may be exposed to prevailing winds. Suitability of these sites also makes them attractive to other nesting seabirds, including gulls, giant petrels, and the imperial shag, among others. Guano from nesting birds represents major nutrient influx and supports unique trophic networks of mosses, lichens, mites/springtails, etc."
,E1,E2,Midland humid ecosystems,"Dominates the mountainous areas of the Antarctic Peninsula, with strong representation in the Transantarctic mountains and Victoria Land. E1B1 and E1B2 are concentrated on the Peninsula, while E1B3 and E1B4 are found all around the continent including on the (mainly southern) Peninsula, particularly where colder and drier conditions intersect with snowy and cloudy midland terrain.","Occurs on somewhat rugged terrain at low-to-mid elevations, usually near the coast. Characterised by high cloud cover, snowfall and relatively high temperatures because of low elevation. Thick snow cover (probably seasonal) remains on the surfaces, which are generally not steep enough for the snow to slide down. Bryophytes and lichens comprise a substantial portion of the terrestrial biota."
1,E1B1,E2B1,Snowy midland tundra,"Occurs mainly along the western/southwestern coast of the northern and central Antarctic Peninsula, with scattered occurrences in Marie Byrd Land, Victoria Land and in the Transantarctic Mountains.","Mainly occurring below 1200 m, this habitat may have gentle to quite steep slopes and typically has thick snow cover. Maritime influence makes conditions mild and cloudy with the highest total precipitation in the typology, but they are in windier locations, span a greater climatic range, have a longer growing season (degree-days above -5 degrees C), and occur on average at the lowest elevations in the environmental unit. The biota is characterised by common lichens, mosses and springtails, with some incidence of Antarctic hair grass (Deschampsia antarctica). This habitat has the most samples of hundreds of species including mosses, lichens, nematodes, mites, and springtails, with over forty found in at least 3 distinct sites. It is also the most commonly sampled habitat for the only two vascular plants in Antarctica. "
2,E1B2,E2B2,Meltwater-eroded midland tundra,"Occurs mainly along the eastern coast of the northern Antarctic Peninsula, though a few notable occurrences are found in the Transantarctic Mountains","Mainly occurring below 1700 m, this habitat encompasses a great variety of midland terrain types and is likely to exhibit seasonally thick snow cover. Relatively warm conditions and high snowfall are accompanied by especially high meltwater erosion, a long growing season, and slightly higher relief than average for the environmental unit. Meltwater erosion results in deep ridges/channels on the surfaces. A number of widespread moss species are accompanied by incidence of Antarctic hair grass and chinstrap penguin colonies. These systems are unsuitable for rotifers and algae."
3,E1B3,E2B3,Cool dry midland inclines,"Widespread in the southern Antarctic Peninsula, Ellsworth Mountains, and the Transantarctic Mountains, Enderby Land and Victoria Land, with a scattering in Marie Byrd Land.","Habitat characterised by relatively gentle terrain though it may encompass low ridges. On the southern Peninsula, it dominates low-relief nunataks and occurs in association with E4B2 where slopes are sunnier or steeper. Habitat is of midland elevations and the least steep and rugged in its unit. Its terrain reminiscent of E5 habitats, the habitat is dry relative to the rest of E2, receiving the lowest snowfall, cloud cover and meltwater in the unit. In some cases, temperature and moisture variables drop below the continental average. Sampled biota are dominated by lichens, but habitat suitability is lower than continental average for rotifers, algaes, and certain lichen groups."
4,E1B4,E2B4,Inland meltwater-eroded mid-highland mountain slopes,"Occurs mainly inland from the coast on the Antarctic Peninsula with a good representation in the Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land, again somewhat isolated from the coast.","Terrain and elevation may be quite variable, but this habitat is characterised by high snowfall, cloud cover, and melt. Usually farther removed from the coast than most E2 units, it is more sheltered from maritime winds, lower in moisture (except E2B3), and higher in elevation than other habitats in environmental unit E2. Satellite imagery shows frequent deep lateral crevasses in adjacent glacier accumulation zones and rock falls where the unit is transitional between E4 units and the glacier below. Sampled biota includes mainly common lichens and occasional mosses. Suitability is low for most functional groups, but higher than the continental average of Bacidiacid, Cladonid, and Rhizocarpid lichens as well as most mosses and mites."
,E4,E3,"Sunny inclines, mountainsides, nunataks and outcrops","Occurs all over Antarctica with good representation, but particularly dominant in Victoria Land",Sunlit (north-facing) rocky slopes with low snow cover that may vary from low to high elevation and relatively gentle to steep grades.
21,E4B1,E3B1,Sunny exposed low-midland hillslopes/screes,"Concentrated in Dronning Maud Land, with minor occurrences on the Antarctic Peninsula and in North Victoria Land.","One of the sunniest habitats on the continent, this relatively mild north-facing ecosystem exhibits mainly medium but occasionally steeper craggy slopes and may be exposed to prevailing wind. It is primarily coastal except in Dronning Maud Land. It is relatively mild but the windiest habitat in E3. In Dronning Maud Land, this habitat often occurs alternating with E4B1 or E5B6 (depending on elevation and ruggedness) where light conditions are variable due to topography and aspect for all 3 habitats, with E3B1 representing well-lit inclines and slopes. On the Peninsula, it may alternate similarly with lowland E1 habitats and is prominently free of snow in summer (see photos). Primary sampled biota are lichens and mosses. Suitability is higher than the rest of E3 for algae, Acarosporacid, Candelarid, and Lecanorid lichens, liverworts, Bryales mosses and slim springtails."
22,E4B2,E3B2,Sunny sheltered midland hillslopes/screes,"A relatively rare unit that is sprinkled across the Antarctic Peninsula, North Victoria Land, Dronning Maud Land and the Transantarctic Mountains.","Typically exhibiting medium to steep rocky slopes that are visibly eroded by meltwater channels, this mild low-midland habitat is often found in association with E2B1 on the Peninsula, with this habitat facing north with meltwater channels in evidence and E2B1 facing south with thick snow cover. The wettest (high snowfall, cloud, and melt) and warmest in E3, with the highest solar radiation. Terrain is similar to E3B1 but sheltered from the prevailing wind. Sampled biota are scarce but suitability is high for Bacidiacid and Cladonid lichens, most mosses, mites, and springtails. The sampled biota appears to be dominated by lichens."
23,E4B3,E3B3,Freeze-thaw slopes,"Predominantly found in North and South Victoria land, with notable incidence in the Transantarctic Mountains and the southern Antarctic Peninsula.","Exhibiting mid- to steep-grade slopes, this unit is usually sheltered from prevailing wind. In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, large swathes of this unit are soil covered and exhibit glacial patterned ground due to freeze-thaw cycles. Sampled biota are common lichens (Parmeliaceae dominant) and mosses (Bryales). Suitability is generally low for most functional groups."
24,E4B4,E3B4,Sunny dry mid-highland sheltered mountain slopes,"Predominantly found in North and South Victoria Land, with notable incidence in the Transantarctic Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, and the northern Antarctic Peninsula.","Typically exhibiting smooth mid- to steep-grade slopes that may nonetheless hold some soil or screes, this habitat has low snowfall, but also the lowest solar radiation, lowest wind, lowest temperatures, and highest elevation in E3. This unit may also exhibit patterned ground due to freeze-thaw cycles. It is frequently found in association with E4B5 where topography and aspect result in varying light conditions. It is prominent on the north-facing mountain sides above the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Recorded biota are mainly lichens. Suitability is generally average or low for all functional groups."
25,E4B5,E3B5,Sunny mid-highland arid exposed nunatak faces and mountain slopes,"Occurrences concentrated in the Prince Charles Mountains (this is the most common E3 unit here), Dronning Maud Land, and Victoria Land. There are minor occurrences in the Transantarctic Mountains and on the Antarctic Peninsula. ","Typically exhibiting mid- to steep-grade slopes, this habitat is otherwise similar in terrain to E3B3 (e.g. smoother surfaces with little evidence of meltwater erosion). It is often found in complexes with other E3 habitats. This habitat is the least cloudy and driest habitat in E3 and has the gentlest relief along with E3B1. Scarce samples are dominated by Arthropods (mites, springtails) and Nematodes, but also contain common lichens. "
,E2,E4,"High cliffs, crags, mountainsides, and slopes","Occurs sprinkled among other ecosystems where steep slopes are present. E2B1 and E2B6 occur patchily on rugged areas of the Peninsula, and all subunits occur in the Transantarctic Mountains.","High elevation, extremely cold, arid, and rugged ecosystems receiving low levels of solar radiation. Slopes are too steep to hold snow layer and are typically barren rock with very little biota. Habitats have little or no growing season. "
6,E2B1,E4B1,Exposed midland escarpments.,"Very common habitat that occurs all around Antarctica, with concentrations in South Victoria Land, Dronning Maud Land, the Ellsworth Mountains and the Transantarctic Mountains. It appears in nearly every ACBR.","Characterised by steep, shadowed slopes, this habitat may be found in close association with sunlit E3 habitats where light conditions vary due to aspect. Habitat is the lowest elevation, warmest and windiest habitat in E4 (which is the steepest and shadiest group), occurring where lower elevation or coastal mountains have sharp, high escarpments. Suitability is higher than usual for E4 for nearly all functional groups but still below continental average in most cases, excepting some lichen groups and Algae. Its sampled biota include several species of arthropods and lichens, most of which are found in more abundance elsewhere, though a few unique singletons have been documented. "
7,E2B2,E4B2,Cloudy escarpments,"Patchy, rare occurrences in the southern Transantarctic Mountains, Ellsworth Mountains, and the Antarctic Peninsula","High, rugged escarpments with some water availability, high cloud cover and highest snowfall in the group. Some instances of this very rare habitat on the Peninsula have a short growing season, whereas most of E4 has almost none. Sampled biota are nearly all singleton species of lichens. "
8,E2B3,E4B3,Sheltered dry highland escarpments,"Occurs mainly in the Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land, as well as the central and southern Antarctic Peninsula.","Surfaces in this habitat are usually quite steep, shadowed, and may be topped by sheer cliff, but sheltered from prevailing wind. May have some limited meltwater erosion. Sampling is nearly absent, with repeat samples only occurring in lichens, and suitability is low for nearly all functional groups, though it is above the unit average for Bacidiacid and Cladonid lichens and several mosses."
9,E2B4,E4B4,Highland clear arid mountain slopes,"Occurs mainly in Victoria Land, the Transantarctic Mountains and Dronning Maud Land. Prominent ecosystem in the escarpments above the McMurdo Dry Valleys, alternating with E3 habitats where aspect makes sunlight conditions variable. Some minor occurrence in the Prince Charles Mountains as well. ","Usually set well back from the coast and removed from maritime influence, this cold (mean temperatures typically below -25 degrees), arid habitat occurs mainly above 1500m and exhibits the lowest snowfall and cloud cover in its group. Terrain may be moderate to quite steep. Sampled biota are scarce but include mostly lichens, nematodes, and a species of Antarctic springtail (Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni). Suitability is low for all functional groups."
10,E2B5,E4B5,Highland clear transitional mountain slopes,"Patchy occurrences distributed around the continent, with concentrations in the Prince Charles Mountains, Victoria Land, the Transantarctic and Ellsworth Mountains, and Enderby Land. Tends to occur in small patches that are interlocked with other habitats.","Habitat has relatively low elevation and gentlest topography in this rugged and high-elevation unit. Sampled biota contains several repeat incidences of nematodes, mites, and springtails in addition to common lichens and algae. The lichen Carbonea capsolata is most commonly sampled in this habitat. "
11,E2B6,E4B6,Highland sheltered escarpments,"This is the most common habitat in the Transantarctic Mountains. There are patchy occurrences in Victoria Land and on the Antarctic Peninsula, particularly inland from permanent ice sheet. Though rare, this habitat represents E4 almost exclusively on Alexander Island. In the Ellsworth Mountains, this habitat covers ice-free areas of the Vinson Massif, Antarctica’s tallest peak. In Dronning Maud Land, this habitat occurs on the peaks of steep nunataks, interlocking with the more common E4B4, which occur on more wind-exposed faces and therefore have less cloud cover. ","Steepest, most rugged and on average coldest unit in E4, usually remote from the coast or occurring coastally adjacent to ice shelf.  Sampled biota are rare, comprising all single samples including several species of mosses, lichens and tardigrades, most of which are found more commonly in other habitats."
,E5,E5,Highland windy plateaus and pediments,Occurs throughout the main continent but is absent from the Antarctic Peninsula,Cold and arid high-elevation flatlands/plateaus with low cloud cover. Characterised especially by high winds.
27,E5B1,E5B1,Windy high plains/flatlands,"Relatively uncommon habitat that occurs mainly in the Transantarctic Mountains, Ellsworth Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, and the Prince Charles Mountains. Occurrences in other bioregions amount to less than 50 km2 per region. ","This dry habitat generally occurs around the low-relief fringes of rugged nunataks, or as isolated rock outcrops rising slightly above the ice sheet. Often unprotected by terrain features, this unit is barren and the windiest unit in the typology. It often occurs in association with E5B4. Several species of lichens, algae, and cyanobacteria have been collected as singletons, but are found more commonly in other habitats. "
28,E5B2,E5B2,Exposed remote plateaus and nunatak fringes,"Rare unit that occurs remote from the coast in the Ellsworth Mountains, Dronning Maud Land, Enderby Land, the Transantarctic Mountains, and Victoria Land.","This habitat is situated on an uncommon juxtaposition of abiotic conditions, where gentle highland terrain encounters modest water availability. Snowfall and cloud cover is relatively high compared to the group despite remoteness from the coast, which may improve suitability for some species by increasing water availability. Primarily associated with windy, flat to rolling dry terrain at high elevations removed from maritime influence and may slope gently. Scarce samples are all singleton diatoms, though this may be a function of sampling patchiness. Suitability in this habitat is generally low for all taxa."
29,E5B3,E5B3,Exposed midland meltwater plateaus,"Modest occurrences are found across the Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land, Prince Charles Mountains, Enderby Land, and the Ellsworth Mountains","Primarily associated with windy, flat to rolling terrain at a mid-range of elevations, sometimes near to the coast, and may be sloping gently. May include both the top of plateaus and the gentle slopes under any escarpments. Though this habitat is dry, it has the highest melt and lowest elevation in E5 and is likely to be eroded by limited seasonal meltwater flow, unlike the rest of its unit. Scarce sampled biota are mainly lichens with three or fewer samples. Suitability is below continental average for all functional groups, but substantially higher than the unit average for nearly all groups, particularly Bacidiacid lichens and all mosses."
30,E5B4 ,E5B4,Remote arid highland bowls,"Predominantly occurs far from the coast in the Transantarctic Mountains, Ellsworth Mountains, and Dronning Maud Land, with modest occurrences sprinkled across the most inland ice-free areas of Victoria Land and the Prince Charles Mountains. This is the most common habitat in the Ellsworth Mountains (just under 20% of ice-free area).","Primarily associated with flat or rolling terrain at higher elevations, this habitat is less windy than the rest of its unit, though still above average compared to the rest of the continent. It tends to occur in the wind shadow of surrounding escarpments or in bowls, sometimes fringing lakes or glaciers nestled in valleys which also diminishes total insolation somewhat. Though snowfall levels are generally low, this habitat may accumulate more blown or drifted snow than surrounding steeper habitats. Sampled biota are very rare, consisting mainly of singleton lichens, algae, and cyanobacteria, most of which are more abundant in other habitats. Suitability is generally low for all functional groups. "
31, E5B5,E5B5,Windy xeric plateaus and moraine fields,"Predominantly found in the Prince Charles Mountains, where it is the most common habitat. Significant incidence of this habitat also occur in the remote highlands of the Transantarctic Mountains and Victoria Land.","Primarily associated flat to undulating terrain at high elevations removed from maritime influence and exposed to strong winds. May include both the top surface of the plateau and the gentle slopes under any escarpments. It also includes many moraine fields left by receding edges of glaciers over time, which produces visually striking patterned terrain reflecting the various stages of glacier recession. This habitat is closely associated with steep habitats in E4 and E3 which often surround it. It is the coldest habitat in the typology (mean annual Temp -30 degrees centigrade), and the clearest, and lowest snowfall habitat in E5. Several species of lichens and Ochrophytes have been sampled but all are singletons and are more abundant in other habitats. Suitability is lower than continental and unit average for all functional groups."
32,E5B6,E5B6,Windy highland moraine fields,"Predominantly found in Dronning Maud Land, and the Transantarctic Mountains, with relatively minor occurrences in Victoria Land and the Prince Charles Mountains. This habitat is found interlocking with E5B6 in the remotest parts of the Transantarctic Mountains and South Victoria land where terrain and snowfall variables differ.","This habitat typically occurs at high elevations and is usually found tucked in basins and on the fringes of nunataks, particularly in Dronning Maud Land. It often skirts habitats from E4 and E3, which form the more rugged nunatak peaks. It has on average higher slope and rugosity than the rest of its unit, but still represents quite gentle terrain relative to adjacent peaks. Satellite imagery indicates patterned debris fields of parallel ridges left by receding glaciers. Scarce sampled biota includes mostly singleton lichens which are more abundant in other habitats. Suitability is lower than continental and unit average for all functional groups."
,G,G,Geologically active areas,"Representation in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, Marie Byrd and Enderby Lands, Victoria Land, and East Antarctica",Areas where geothermal processes influence the environment or biota of ecosystems either directly or historically. 
100,G1,G1,Active Volcanoes,Northern Antarctic Peninsula and Victoria Land,"Recent and ongoing volcanic activity associated with active volcanoes is a highly influential ecological driver of ecosystem processes and biota. Active volcanoes that erupted within the last 1,000 years occur only at three restricted sites in the McMurdo volcanic field in northern Victoria Land (Mt Erebus, Mt Melbourne and Mt Rittmann) and one on Deception Island (South Shetlands). Mt Erebus on Ross Island is currently erupting and is closely associated with Mt Terror and Mt Terra Nova, which have been dormant for 800,000 years, but are likely influenced by eruptions of Mt Erebus, and are thus included in Ecosystem type G1. The most recent eruptions of Mt Melbourne and Mt Rittmann were in 1892+/-30 and 1252+/-2, respectively. The Deception Island volcano is less elevated and isolated from the others and last erupted in 1970. All four active volcanoes are characterized by elevated temperatures and ongoing gaseous emissions. Three other volcanoes (Mt Hampton, Mt Kauffman, and Mt Berlin) exhibit some evidence of ongoing geothermal activity, but their status as active or dormant is yet to be resolved (Herbold et al. 2014).
Active volcanoes are polyextremophilic environments. The key physical features of these ecosystems include geothermal heat and steep thermal gradients relative to the surrounding landscape; periodic disturbance by volcanic eruptions, ash deposition or lava flow; emission of volcanic aerosols that contribute to dispersion of microorganisms (Van Eaton et al. 2013) and enrichment of nutrient levels (Garcia-Lopez et al. 2022). These ecosystems also include fumaroles (ice towers) and associated ice caves that form around vents, collapsing and rebuilding over decadal time scales. "
200,G2,G2,Dormant volcanoes,"Marie Byrd Land and Enderby Land, Victoria Land","Dormant volcanoes last erupted 1,000 - 100,000 years ago. The geophysical and biological legacies of those events are likely to persist to varying degrees, distinguishing these habitats from their surrounding landscapes. Their substrates are likely to retain high levels of nutrients. Gaseous emissions may or may not occur (Bargagli et al. 2004), but are generally less abundant than those that characterize active volcanoes (G1). Dormant volcanoes may also function as glacial refugia for unique biota. Older inactive volcanoes, that last erupted more than 100,000 years ago, generally lack these features and were classified with non-volcanic ecosystem types. Examples of dormant volcanoes occur within Marie Byrd Land, Victoria Land and Enderby Land, including the Hudson Mountains, Mt. Berlin, Mt. Takahe, Penguin Island and The Pleiades."
300,G3,G3,Non-volcanic geothermal ecosystems,Broknes Peninsula in the Larsemann Hills,"Geothermal heating of base rocks and water can result from processes other than volcanism. Such heating is presently known only from one small area of Antarctica on the Broknes Peninsula in the Larsemann Hills, where Cambrian rocks are heated by radiogenic decay (Fraser et al. 2014). These ecosystems lack gaseous emissions and nutrient release that distinguish volcanic geothermal ecosystems (G1 and G2). They are also characterised by a more moderate range of temperatures than active volcanoes. Radiogenic decay within rocks sustains geothermal heating over hundreds of millions of years. During climate shifts to glacial maxima, this sustained heating is thought to buffer conditions locally, as ice cover advances across the broader landscape. Higher levels of biological diversity at geothermal sites than in non-geothermal sites support the notion that geothermal sites function as ice-free refuges for ice-sensitive biota. while patterns of nestedness with distance from geothermal sites suggest recolonization occurs by dispersal from the refuges during glacial retreat (Fraser et al. 2014). Non-volcanic geothermal ecosystems are restricted to geological substrates with rare minerals undergoing radiogenic decay. This maintains mild soil and rock temperatures. Mineral nutrients are derived only from gradual weathering and, unlike volcanic geothermal ecosystems, are not periodically replenished by eruptions or aerosol emissions. The biota of non-volcanic geothermal ecosystems is poorly studied, but exhibits high richness of bryophytes and lichens relative to most non-geothermal sites (Fraser et al. 2014). A range of cold-sensitive species inhabit the surface and subsurface. It also supports a range of soil- and moss-dwelling invertebrates. Herbold et al. (2014) describe the major groups of microbes found in the substrate, including Cyanobacteria, Actinobateria, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria."
500,L,L,Lakes,"Current knowledge about the distribution of Antarctic lakes is incomplete; however, over 1,300 terrestrial lakes have been mapped in ice-free areas. About 200 lakes have been documented in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, mainly on Deception Island and James Ross Island. Hundreds of lakes ranging from a few metres to a few kilometres across are dotted across the McMurdo Dry Valleys and extend down into North Victoria Land. Lakes are also documented in Marie Byrd Land, Dronning Maud Land, Enterby Land, the Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica, and the Transantarctic Mountains. Some areas, such as the Vestfold Hills and the Larsemann Hills, have notably high concentrations of lakes of various sizes, containing hundreds of lakes across a relatively small area.","Antarctica has a diverse range of lake types, including surface lakes, wetlands and seepages, supraglacial lakes, epishelf lakes, and subglacial lakes. Habitat Complex L is constrained to surface lakes, and wetlands and seepages are covered in E1B2 and E1B5. Surface lakes are generally situated in coastal areas, particularly those that are permanently ice free. They range from small ponds, to kettle lakes and large lake systems such as Radok Lake (20 km2 and 346 m deep) in the Amery Oasis and Crooked Lake (>9 km2 and over 150 m deep) in the Vestfold Hills (Laybourn-Parry and Wadham, 2014). At least six surface lake types have been identified which include: stable lakes on higher-altitude areas; coastal lakes; stable lakes in old moraines; small unstable lakes in young moraines; deep cirque lakes; and kettle lakes (Nedbalov? et al. 2013). They occur where meltwater drainage pathways flow from snowfields, glaciers, the ice sheet and permafrost into basins or depressions (including on glaciers and ice sheets) and are often spatially isolated. Conditions range from frozen solid to their bases in winter to seasonally ice covered, losing surface ice cover for a few weeks to months in summer, with some lakes being ice free year round due to their salinity. Ponds, kettle lakes and associated wetlands are found commonly in the McMurdo Dry Valleys and are also seasonally active and vary in size interannually. Coastal lakes can be very numerous in some areas, for example there are over 300 lakes and ponds in the Vestfold Hills (Laybourn-Parry and Wadham, 2014), hundreds of lakes in the Bunger Hills (Klokov et al. 1990) and 150 freshwater lakes and ponds in the Larsemann Hills (Gillieson et al. 1990). 
The geochemistry of Antarctic lakes is principally driven by salinity, redox conditions and nutrient and organic carbon supply. Salinities vary from freshwater through to hypersaline basins where seawater from previous sea levels was trapped.? Some saline lakes are permanently stratified or meromictic, with strong physical and chemical gradients between upper mixed layers and lower unmixed layers. Dissolved oxygen conditions range from fully oxic to anoxic, with surface waters and ice margins usually well oxygenated but dissolved oxygen declining with depth, due to oxygen consumption by microbial respiration exceeding atmospheric diffusion or phototrophic production. The majority of lakes in Antarctica are oligotrophic or ultra-oligotrophic. Catchments of bare rock in continental regions provide little nutrient input, but in the Maritime Antarctic where there are vegetated catchments, inputs of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous occur. Higher nutrient levels and eutrophication can occur in some areas due to inputs of faecal material from penguins or seals. 
Lakes and wetlands support biodiversity and contribute carbon to surrounding soils. Antarctic lake biota includes benthic and planktonic communities. Plankton communities are usually dominated by prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, including Archaea, Bacteria, Algae, Protozoa, and viruses. The benthos is often dominated by cyanobacterial mats, but can include mosses in some areas. Metazoans are usually sparse but include crustaceans (copepods, cladocerans and anostracans), nematodes, tardigrades, oligochaetes, chironomid larvae and tubellarians."
