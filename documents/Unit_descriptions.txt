Env1_sdm1, Low elevation lichen fields. Primarily occurs on flat, rocky coastlines or low outcrops, which may receive thick seasonal snow cover. Higher moisture (cloud, melt, and precip) than the rest of the group. The dominant biota are several common lichen species. May be suitable colony habitat for some penguins.

Env1_sdm2, Arid lichen fields. Primarily occurs on flat, rocky coastlines or low outcrops, but colder and windier than [1] on average. Receives less cloud cover, precip, and melt than [1]. Emperor penguin colonies are common. Exhibits unusually high endemicity of weird species including tardigrades, rotifers, and arthropods. 

Env1_sdm3 Rocky coastal tundra. Unit is warmer and wetter than the rest of the group. On the Antarctic peninsula, unit hosts bird colonies that nest on bare ground or moss/grass fields. This is the only non-island unit that may have vascular plants, but it is mainly dominated by lichens, mosses, and nesting birds. 

Env1_sdm4 Flat valley bottoms. Flat or rolling valley bottoms often carved by glaciers and surrounded by high/steep peaks. Relatively sheltered from the wind. Often contains lakes. May extend quite far inland. Unit is colder than the rest of the subgroup, but still warmer than the continental average. May have slightly rougher terrain than the subgroup and has distinctly less wind. Dominant biota appears to be lichens, though suitability is higher than usual for Nematodes, Rotifers, and Trombidiformes (mites). Suitability for most mosses low (though still higher than continental average). 

Env1_sdm5 Lowland outcrops. Occurs on low rocky outcrops that are not necessarily coastal and may be at higher elevations than most of Env1.  Dominant biota are mosses, but lichens and some nematodes are also widespread. Displays unusually high endemicity for several cyanobacteria species, for which it has high suitability. Unit is higher elevation and wind than the rest of the subgroup, but still lower than continental average. More cold and arid than rest of the subgroup. 

Env2_sdm1 Occurs mainly in the rugged areas of Alexander and Adelaide Islands on the peninsula. This unit is warmest and wettest within the subgroup but may also be more rugged despite lowish elevations. Sampled biota consists mainly of common lichen and moss species, but also has unusually high suitability for penguins, Hypnales and Polytrichales mosses and Bacidiaceae and Cladoniaceae Lichens.

Env2_sdm2 Occurs mainly in the south Antarctic peninsula, Ellsworth mountains, and western end of the Transantarctic mountains. On the south peninsula, it occurs in association with Env5 (may be quite similar to some Env5 units). Most arid and cold unit in Env2, receiving relatively low snowfall. Unit is higher elevation than its group but not rugged, colder and drier than rest of the subgroup (melt, precip, and temp variables low). In some cases, temp and moisture variables drop below continental average. Sampled biota appear to be mainly mosses, but suitability is lower than continental average for most functional groups, particularly Ochrophytes, Nematodes, and penguins. 

Env2_sdm3 Occurs mainly on the west side of the northern Antarctic peninsula. Unit is wetter, warmer, and lower elev than rest of its group, though may be somewhat rugged. Main sampled biota is various mosses and may host the two vascular plant species in some cases. Suitability is higher than average for a variety of functional groups includng penguins, but is especially low for Ochrophytes an Rotifers. 

Env2_sdm4 Occurs mainly along the highest peaks running through the centre of the peninsula. Similar to env2_sdm2 but receive a lot more snowfall. Unit is relatively high elevation but typical of the group in most variables. Fauna are primarily lichens, and suitability is especially low for Ochrophytes and Chlorophytes.

Env3_sdm1. Occurs mainly in the Transantarctic mountains, Victoria Land and Dronning Maud land. Unit has especially low cloud and highest wind in the group. Main sampled biota appears to be arthopods (springtails and mites) but Chlorophyta, Nematodes, and lichens are also represented. Suitability appears especially low for many mosses, penguins, and some lichens (Cladoniaceae and Bacidiaceae).

Env3_sdm2 Steep coastal wind-shaded cliffs and mountainsides. Occurs mainly along the Eastern coast of the peninsula and throughout the Transantarctic mountains and Victoria Land. Lowest wind and warmest temps in the group, relatively moist (cloud and precip). Unit is lower than group average but still above continental average in elevation, but higher than both in rugosity and slope. Biota are mainly lichens with some nematodes sampled. 

Env3_sdm3 Occurs mainly in the Transantarctic mountains, Victoria land, and the Prince Charles mountains. May be both coastal and inland.  Does not deviate much from group averages except that it's less cloudy, maybe a tad less rugged than the group average. Most sampled biota are nematodes, but lichens and Entognatha (Arthropods) are also represented. Suitability is low for most functional groups, but Suitability for Ochrophyta and Rotifera is above the continental average, and suitability for Chlorophyta and Nematoda are above the group average. Unit is particularly unsuitable for penguins.

Env3_sdm4 Steep coastal wind-exposed cliffs and mountainsides. Occurs mainly in the North peninsula and western Transantarctic mountains. Cloudier and a bit more rugged than rest of unit and than the continental average. Sampled biota is a mix of nematodes, lichens, mosses, and Arthropods. Suitability is lower than the continental average for all functional groups, but is apparently highest for Ochrophytes and perhaps some lichen groups. 

Env3_sdm5 Inland high mountains. Occurs mainly in the Transantarctic mountains and Victoria land. This unit is an extreme example, higher and colder than the unit average. Unit does not occur near the coast. Biota is sparse but consists mainly of lichens, but suitability is below the continental average for all functional groups. The highest suitability is apparently for Ochrophyta. 

Env4_sdm1. Occurs mainly on the eastern coast of the northern peninsula, Dronning Maud land, Enderby land, and in the Prince Charles mountains. This unit is especially windy and high in radiation (North-facing slopes?). Sampled fauna is scarce but consists of lichens, a few mosses and the occasional tardigrade. Suitability is below continental average for all functional groups in Env 4 but this unit nonetheless has higher than continental average suitability for Candelariaceae, Rhizocarpaceae, Acarosporaceae and to a lesser extent Permeliaceae lichens. 

Env4_sdm2. Occurs mainly on the eastern coast of the northern peninsula and in Victoria Land. This unit is on the milder end of the group, with more ruggedness and cloud and less wind/higher temp than the group average, though still high radiation. Most sampled faunas are Rotifers, though singletons of various other groups have been detected. Suitability appears to be especially low for many lichen functional groups (but high for Cladoniaceae and Bacidiaceae) and Trombidiformes (Arachnids) and high for chinstrap penguins and several moss groups.

Env4_sdm3. Occurs mainly in Victoria land, Enderby Land and in the Prince Charles mountains. Its elevation is lower than the rest of the group, but it is especially windy and low in cloud cover (radians are not especially high for the group, possibly due to aspect? East, west, and south-facing slopes?). Sampled biota are exclusively lichens. Though the group has lower suitability than the continental average for all functional groups, this unit nonetheless has higher-than-average suitability for Ochrophytes, Rotifers, and Acarosporaceae lichens.

Env4_sdm4. Mainly occurs in Victoria land with some representation on the eastern coast of the northern peninsula. Unit is lower in cloud and wind than the rest of its group (likely also south-facing?), so a milder version. Sampled biota is scarce and consists mainly of singletons. Most are lichens and cyanobacteria, along with some Ochrophyta and mosses. Suitability above group average but still below continental average for Ochrophyta, Rotifera, Nematoda, and Trombidiformes.

Env4_sdm5. Mainly occurs in Victoria land and Dronning Maud land. Unit is higher elevation, wind, and radiation than the rest of the group, plus lower temp and lower ruggedness. Extremely low sampling but most are Athropods. Suitability is lower than group average for all functional groups except Parmeliaceae lichens, and especially bad for penguins. 

Env5_sdm1 Group 5 consists of high elevation but low wind areas, on average colder and lower precip than the continent. This unit is a mild version of its group, with lower elev and higher temps than the rest of the group. Sampled fauna consists exclusively of lichens. Unit is separated from its group more by suitability; group has low suitability for all functional groups except Ochrophytes, but the unit has exceptionally high suitability for all lichens except Cladoniaceae and Bacidiaceae (for these latter two conditions are only slightly better than usual); all Arthropoda functional groups, and Pottiales mosses.

Env5_sdm2 Very similar to previous unit environmentally; may be slightly colder and higher elevation. Main sampled biota consists of lichens and mosses. Suitability again separates this unit from its group and the previous unit; it has highest suitability for penguins, Cladoniaceae and Bacidaceae lichens, and several functional groups of mosses. 

Env5_sdm3 This unit has higher elev/ruggedness and colder temps than the rest of its group, constituting a more extreme example of the group. Sampled fauna mostly Cyanobacteria and Chlorophyta. Suitability is bad for everything, but slightly less bad for Cladoniaceae, Bacidiaceae, and penguins. 

Env5_sdm4 This unit is higher in elev and lower in temp than the rest of its group (not as high as previous unit). It has especially low cloud cover. Main sampled fauna are Athropods, Nematodes, and Chlorophytes. Suitability terrible for most functional groups except Chlorophyta and Ochrophyta.

Env5_sdm5 This unit is clearer and colder than the rest of its group. Sampled biota mainly Chlorophytes, Cyanobacteria, and lichens. Suitability is low for every group and especially some lichen groups. 

Env6_sdm1 This unit has no abiotic variables due to being on the coast, so most pixels will be low, coastal or islands, and relatively warm. This unit's most sampled biota are adelie penguins and Bryum pseudotriquetum (moss). Ochrophytes are also well-represented. Several Ochrophyte and Athropod species seem to prefer this unit over all others. Suitability is high for all functional groups in this environmental group, especially Mesostimata, Sarcoptiformes, penguins, and Rhizocarpaceae and Parmeliaceae lichens. In this unit, suitability is high especially for Rotifers, Ochrophytes, and several Lichen groups. 

Env6_sdm2 Islands. This unit occurs exclusively on the outer tip of the Antarctic peninsula. It is teeming with penguins, features antarctic hair grass, two moss species, followed by a variety of lichens and arthropods. Snowy Sheathbill is found primarily in this unit., as are gentoo penguins, both vascular plants, and several moss and lichen species. Suitability is high for pretty much everything except Rotifers. This is probably the most habitable unit on the continent. 

Env6_sdm3 Islands. Most common biota is adelie penguins, but also Emperor penguins and south polar skua. Several Arthropod, moss, and lichen species are also present in numbers. It is the most popular ecosystem for several Rotifer species, two Arthropods, and the skua. Suitability is high for everything, especially Arthropod functional groups and Nematodes. 

Env6_sdm4 Islands. Also occurs primarily on the peninsula, and sampling is dominated by penguins (Adelie, gentoo, and chinstrap). Imperial shag and southern giant petrel also present in good numbers. Hair grass and several Arthopod species are also abundant. This is the most popular ecosystem for the imperial shag and many arthropod species. Suitability is low for Ochrophytes and Rotifers but high for basically everything else. 

Env6_sdm5 Islands. Mainly mosses and some common lichens, good representation of Adelies, southern giant petrels, snow petrels, wilsons storm petrels, and antarctic petrels, being the most preferred habitat for the latter three. Several Buellia (lichen) species also prefer this habitat, along with a chlorophyte and two tardigrade species. 

Env6_sdm6 Islands. Adelie, SP skua, Cape petrel, southern fulmar, chinstrap and gentoo pengins dominate along with a variety of moss species.  Suitability low for ochrophytes and rotifers but high for everything else. 

Env6_sdm7 Islands. Pengins are most commonly sampled but several other bird species make an appearance. It is not the favourite of any species. Several mosses and a common lichen group dominate the sampled flora. Low suitability for rotifers but high for everything else, particularly Mesostigmata (arthopod), Rhizocarpaceae (lichen), chlorophytes, and Parmeliaceae (lichen).
