Code,Name,Distribution,Description
E1,Mild lowlands,"Occurs all around Antarctica with particular concentrations on the Antarctic Peninsula, in the Transantarctic Mountains, and Victoria Land. Dominates the coastal outcrops around the eastern margin of the continent.","Relatively warm, flat/level habitats, often coastal but not always. Elevations are low and topography is gentle. May be rocky and barren, but often hosts bird colonies and pinnipeds if occurring near the coast."
E2,Midland humid habitats,"Dominates the mountainous areas of the Antarctic Peninsula, with strong representation in the Transantarctic mountains and Victoria Land. E1B1 and E1B2 are concentrated on the Peninsula, while E1B3 and E1B4 are found all around the continent including on the (mainly southern) Peninsula, particularly where colder and drier conditions intersect with snowy and cloudy midland terrain. ","Occurs on somewhat rugged terrain at low-to-mid elevations, usually near the coast. Characterised by high cloud cover, snowfall and relatively high temperatures because of low elevation. Thick snow cover (probably seasonal) remains on the surfaces, which are generally not steep enough for the snow to slide down. Bryophytes and lichens comprise a substantial portion of the terrestrial biota. "
E3,Midland dry/sunny habitats,"Occurs all over Antarctica with good representation, but particularly dominant in Victoria Land",Sunlit (north-facing) rocky slopes with low snow cover that may vary from low to high elevation and relatively gentle to steep grades.
E4,High mountains,"Occurs sprinkled among other ecosystems where steep slopes are present. E2B1 and E2B6 occur patchily on rugged areas of the Peninsula, and all subunits occur in the Transantarctic Mountains.","High elevation, extremely cold, arid, and rugged ecosystems receiving low levels of solar radiation. Slopes are too steep to hold snow layer and are typically barren rock with very little biota. Habitats have little or no growing season. "
E5,High flatlands,Occurs throughout the main continent but is absent from the Antarctic Peninsula,Cold and arid high-elevation flatlands/plateaus with low cloud cover. Characterised especially by high winds.
G,Geologically active areas,"Representation in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, Marie Byrd and Enderby Lands, Victoria Land, and East Antarctica",Areas where geothermal processes influence the environment or biota of ecosystems either directly or historically. 
L,Lakes,"Current knowledge about the distribution of Antarctic lakes is incomplete; however, over 1,300 terrestrial lakes have been mapped in ice-free areas. About 200 lakes have been documented in the northern Antarctic Peninsula, mainly on Deception Island and James Ross Island. Hundreds of lakes ranging from a few metres to a few kilometres across are dotted across the McMurdo Dry Valleys and extend down into North Victoria Land. Lakes are also documented in Marie Byrd Land, Dronning Maud Land, Enterby Land, the Prince Charles Mountains, East Antarctica, and the Transantarctic Mountains. Some areas, such as the Vestfold Hills and the Larsemann Hills, have notably high concentrations of lakes of various sizes, containing hundreds of lakes across a relatively small area. ",
