Group,Code,Name,Description
Environment 1,Env1,Midland humid ecosystems,"Occurs on somewhat rugged terrain at low-to-mid elevations, usually near or directly on the coast. Dominates the mountainous areas of the Antarctic peninsula, with representation in the Ellsworth mountains and the westernmost end of the Transantarctic mountains. Characterised by high cloud cover and precipitation, relatively high temperatures because of low elevation. Thick snow cover (probably seasonal) remains on the surfaces, which are mostly not steep enough for the snow to slide down. Biota consists mainly of mosses and lichens."
Environment 2,Env2,"High cliffs, crags, mountainsides, and slopes","High elevation, extremely cold, arid, and rugged ecosystems. Good representation in all mountainous areas, sprinkled among other ecosystems where steep slopes are present. Slopes are too steep to hold snow layer and are typically barren rock with very little biota. Particular subunits cover rugged areas of the peninsula, and all subunits occur in the Transantarctic mountains."
Environment 3,Env3,Warm lowlands,"Relatively warm, flat/level ecosystems, often coastal but not always. Elevations low and topography is gentle. May be rocky and barren, but often hosts bird colonies and pinnipeds if occurring near the coast."
Environment 4,Env4,"High, sunny inland hills and outcrops","Cold, arid, Mid-to-high elevation and high ruggedness highlands/nunataks with low wind, and high levels of solar radiation (typically north-facing)"
Environment 5,Env5,Highland windy plateaus and outcrops,"Coldest, most arid high-elevation flatlands/plateaus/rounded hills (low ruggedness) with low cloud cover. Characterised especially by high wind. "
