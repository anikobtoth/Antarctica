Regional units are necessary for a more local view of the Antarctic ice-free typology. Regional units are useful for performing targeted IUCN risk assessments. 

Regional units were generated by first taking the continental typology and intersecting it with the Antarctic Conservation Bioregions (ACBRs). This resulted in 328 potential units, some with as few as a single pixel. Regional units with tiny areas are unlikely to be regarded as unique ecosystems locally, so these original 328 units were subjected to a lumping process according to the logic tree below.

This logic resulted in in 158 candidate regional units. Of these, 82 are a single unit-ACBR combination, and 76 consist of 2 or more lumped raw regional units. 33 units were discarded due to tiny area (largest had 40 pixels) and no possibility of merging (no adjacent cells from same group). Because most pixels aren't filled with ice-free land, 40 pixels amounts to likely ~10-20km2. 

Below are maps of the proposed merges. Many are a very small unit lumped into a larger one which surrounds it. These seem pretty logical. 

A few of the proposed merges seem to go a bit too far by lumping too many units. It's up for discussion how to filter these.

A small number of lumped regional units have too few pixels to really be counted even after lumping. 

There are also some cases where it might be better to lump some pixels of a regional unit with another one due to spatial clumping. These are also up for discussion.


```{r proposed_merges, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#library(patchwork)
#(reduce(p, `/`))

#purrr::map(p[which(m > 1)], ~.)

p[which(m>1)]
```
